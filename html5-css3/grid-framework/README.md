Clone of the [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) homepage (partial and without images) using a basic 12-column grid  framework. This project is made for [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com)'s CSS3 [Final Project: Design your Own Grid-Based Framework](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).

##What Iâ€™ve learned
- build a simple grid framework
- use a framework to clone a website
- Fix collapsing using the pseudo selector `:after`
- Use attribute selector to select attribute begins with certain value
