- understand the difference between puts and printf
- get user input with gets.chomp
- use conditional branching and looping techniques with case statements and while loops
- manipulate strings using methods like .ljust and .split
- iterate through collections using .each and .collect
- check to see if an element is part of a collection using .include?
- add elements to an existing array with the syntax array << element
- select specific elements of array using the syntax array[0] and array[1..-1]
- set up and use an API (Application Programming Interface)
